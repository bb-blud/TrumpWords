# TrumpWords

Using word2vec to observe common themes on a very biased selection of text, i.e., a small compilation of words spoken by DJT  
Nothing very deep is going on here, it mostly serves to get a toddler up to speed who has not been watching the news for 
the past year and a half.

## Higlights!

After arduous training we conclude that;

Hillary: clinton-> plastic (???)-> beat -> leadership -> failed -> her -> reset  
America:  again -> make -> rich -> god -> wealthy -> great -> deals -> winning  
Great: fantastic -> deals -> patriots -> america  
Terrorism: islamic -> radical -> defeat  
Press: fake (obviously)  
China: mexico -> devaluation -> moving -> lose -> currency -> jobs -> devalue ->trades  
build: wall (lol)  
President: Obama -> elected (certainly true)  




## Next steps

It would be interesting to use word2vec on larger amounts of text that are still heavily confined to some conceptual area  
maybe some profiling can be deduced. Also to repeat this experiment with other people, again mabye use TSNE to profile speech 
patterns.
